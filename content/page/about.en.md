I am Raddah Al Zahrani, and I am passionate about technology, particularly free and open-source software, both on the hardware and software fronts. I have worked in various fields within operating technologies and information technology and have established several small and large projects.

I can describe myself as a passionate and ambitious individual with a strong skill set in the realm of free and open-source software. Over the years, I have been dedicated to achieving innovation and development in this vast field, from initiating and sharing projects to generating new ideas.

I firmly believe in the importance of acquiring knowledge and working diligently without boundaries. I am convinced that goodness always lies in the hands of those who work hard and tirelessly strive to promote this belief or philosophy.

I spend my time with experimentation, learning, and teaching across various technical and information technology aspects in my small laboratory. Here, I engage in a wide array of fields, ranging from hardware and controllers to system development and operation, utilizing artificial intelligence, deep learning, blockchain, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing technologies.
