Peace and blessings be upon you,


Here I am, echoing the sentiment: "We have returned, and returning is an expression of gratitude." I've been absent from blogging for a long time, and there are several reasons for my hiatus. However, some factors have made my return to blogging easier after a very long break, with the most significant reason being the desire to write in an unrestricted space.

# Reasons for My Return to Blogging
## 1. Unrestricted Space

I have an aversion to restrictions. Some content-sharing and publishing platforms have policies and privacy terms I'd rather not navigate. Therefore, having your personal website or blog gives you the advantage of independence and lack of constraints.

Another aspect of technical restrictions, like using content management software, requires me to keep up with the latest updates, security patches, software upgrades, and improvements. It also demands extra effort to fix bugs and patches, which I simply don't have time for. I want something straightforward, thanks to the fantastic technological advancements that allow for the creation of static pages with advanced techniques.

## 2. Sharing What's in My Arsenal

I regret that I left blogging in its various forms, as I haven't shared my personal thoughts and work. I am currently working on self-improvement and other topics I find relevant in the tech world and society. So, I'll diversify my ways of sharing by actively participating in social media and creating visual content whenever time allows.

## 3. My Love for Reading and Writing

Of course, the field I love to read about the most is the tech field, and I'll be happy to share what I've read, not only in the tech realm but also in other areas I'm interested in. Blogging helps me organize and articulate information in a simple way, which cements it in my memory and for anyone visiting my humble blog.

## 4. Backup Copy

A revised version of my posts from other websites and platforms will be kept as a backup. I will preserve a backup copy of important topics that I believe have high value from my perspective.

### Speical Thansk

A special thanks to everyone who has contributed to helping me, whether directly or indirectly, and of course, I want to first express my gratitude to the template designer, Jimmy, the creator of the Stack template.

I'd also like to thank my friends:

1- Engineer [Faris](https://fariszr.com/), the Technical Director of the [AOSUS](https://aosus.org) community.

2- Engineer [Fahad Aldraibi](https://www.fadvisor.net/blog/ ).
